# drive-untrash
Simple single page app to untrash all files for a Google Drive account

Automatcially runs on load, so just by loading the page, your files will be untrashed.

The URL to load the app, and as explained above, untrash your files is at http://46.23.70.96:8010/du

Make sure that aren't blocking popups from the origin, as this is needed for the authorization dialogue
